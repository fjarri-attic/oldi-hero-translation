# The hero must be alone
**can we keep the wordplay in the title?**

And then Serpent's voice sounded:

"A mortal holds the sky with the gods. What of the titans then?"

And he heard:

"We are not needed. Never will the titans rise again. Their world is over. On one shoulder he holds the sky."

"Only the gods are needed? The Chronids?"

"Neither are the gods needed. Gods too he overcomes. Unshackled he holds the sky, because he is the Power." **or Force?**

And the Serpent croaked gloomily:

"Yes, now I know Hercules..."

**Can we keep the wordplay with the second book?**

With all the conviction of modern man that the gods of Greece are only a product of imagination and that they never existed anywhere, all these gods stand before us - Zeus, Hera, Athena, Aphrodite, and even lesser gods, nymphs and satyrs - clothed into flesh and blood, and so alive that it takes a lot of mental energy to get rid of this glittering vision.

### Parodos [1]

Darkness.

A viscous, dense darkness with shimmering reflections somewhere, on the very edge, in the suffocating dampness of the local air - cloyingly warm and at the same time causing chills.

Crimson flashes.

It seems that very close, a stone's throw, the outlines of either a mossy wall or a cliff appear... no, this is just an illusion, the darkness keeps its secrets well from the uninitiated...

However, it keeps its secrets from the initiates just as well, deceiving fools with the appearance of insight.

Rumble.

A distant underground rumble - like the breath of a sleeping giant, like the murmur of a giant heart, like a hopeless and endless groan of myriads of shadows in the darkness of Erebus...

A smooth rustle of waves. Yes, this is it. The river by which the gods swear rolls its black waters - an eternal river, invisible and inevitable, without end or beginning; and pale corollas of asphodel sway along its banks.

Darkness.

Flashes.

Chilling stuffiness.

The roar of the water.

That is all.

* * *

"Here we are, Middle. Sit down. We don't have to go further - there are no ears that can overhear us in this place."

Something stirred in the darkness, and the earth shook.

"Some place you chose, Senior..."

"I didn't choose. You did. You and Junior. I took what was left. And besides, do you know of a safer place? I don't."

"You're right, brother. Let's get down to business - I can't wait to get out of here."

"Many can't wait. Yet they do."

"I am not the many, Senior. And I don't like ambiguity. So tell me straight, no nonsense - do you know of Junior's last plan?"

"What do you think?"

"You're right again. It is annoying sometimes... Of course, you know everything. But did you think what this might lead to?"

"I often have to think, Middle - the environment helps..." **literally "is conductive to it" - any better phrasing?**

The face of the speaker (if, of course, he has one) is not visible, but the tone of the answer leaves no doubt that the Senior is now grinning sarcastically.

"Then you must understand how dangerous this idea is, if it comes true! Junior is afraid of losing power, he is always afraid of losing power and frantically comes up with new... new weapons, and we still keep quiet and turn a blind eye to the possible consequences! Previously, it was acceptable - not the same scale, not the same power, not to mention that without us, without the Family..."

"That's right, Middle - without us! By themselves, Halfmen are only capable of destroying their own kind, and no more... But with us - oh, with us, as it turned out, they are capable of many things! They turned out to be great Scavengers! And you, Middle, you yourself produced bastard heroes with great pleasure, not caring for any considerations! Isn't that right, Sea Stallion?! Well tell me, tell me again - 'you are right, brother'!"

"Stop it!"

In the voice of Middle the sea rumbles menacingly - stormy, terrible, foaming shaggy crests of waves.

Darkness.

Flashes.

Chilling stuffiness.

That is all.

"Don't anger me, Senior. This is not why I came here. And I don't want to quarrel with you. We could always see eye to eye - everyone: you, and me, and the Sisters. Everyone except Junior. And now too - without listening to anyone, he intends to spawn a Lone Scavenger! Lightnings are not enough for him - he wants a live lightning! And if Junior succeeds..."

"I hope he does," Senior mutters, but Middle pretends not to hear.

"...won't we have to pay too dear a price for Junior's recklessness and lust for power?! Remember one of the first ones - the one who killed Medusa, the youngest of the Gorgons! Remember Perseus!"

Senior is silent.

Senior is silent for a long time.

"Did you really love her, Middle?" he asks suddenly.

Middle doesn't answer.

"You did," Senior continues confidently, and the flashes wink from afar, bending and pulsing. "Only from a great love could Medusa have children such as Pegasus and Chrysaor the Golden Bow. You loved her, Blackmane! And that's why you came to hate Perseus with all his offspring! Perhaps, if Junior went today not to a woman of the Perseids, but to any other, you would..."

"Don't be silly, Senior! I am far from personal accounts - further than you think! Although I do not forget anything and do not forgive insults. But you, do you remember what a shock it was for the whole Family - to learn that those like us can be killed permanently too?! That a Scavenger, trash, a Halfman, is capable of something none of the Family can do?! Do you remember that?!"

"I remember," Senior replies dully.

"Can you guess then what the very same Perseus the Scavenger began to consider as he was getting older?"

"Can I guess?" laughs the darkness, and unhappy is its laughter. "*I know!* I myself asked him about it when he came to me. The blood of the sacrificial cow warmed Perseus's memory, and he had nothing to lose - he had lost everything. 'I don’t regret anything,' he said, and I shuddered when I saw his smile, 'except for one thing... I should not have given Alalkomena [2] the head of Medusa. But since I did, I at least should have let them look each other in the eyes. Relatives, after all... Answer me, Overlord **is there an actual title similar to this?** - would you then dare to send Thanatos [3] after me?' And I didn't answer him, Middle! I was silent, and he was smiling..."

Silence. And only the black water of Styx splashes on the foot of the White Cliff of Oblivion, invisible in the darkness, as if washing away from it the bitterness of Overlord's last words.

"And he was smiling," repeats Middle. "He was smiling. Here. And after that, you don't want to prevent the Lone Scavenger from being born? Strange... very strange. Are you getting old, Overlord?"

"What do you suggest, Middle?"

"To begin with, talk to Junior. Convince him not to do it. The Moirai [4] have not yet spun the thread, so everything is reversible. Perhaps Junior will listen to both of us..."

"He didn't listen to you alone, it seems. Don't be naive, Middle - you know Zeus as well as I do! If he has decided on something, you will not dissuade him, even if you turn the world inside out."

"Alas, Senior," the sea sighs. "Can't dissuade him. Moreover, he is doing *this* right at this moment. Without consulting anyone!"

"Has he ever consulted anyone? Even when he turned against his father - he did it himself, and the Family simply joined in..."

Middle sighs resoundingly again.

"Junior has become dangerous," he says with hidden hatred, and it seems that this hatred will now explode the thickened darkness with a dazzling white flash.

"Junior has become dangerous. This is over the top! It's time to displace him - and put an end to this new recklessness! I have sufficient support from the Family..."

"But it's not enough for you to openly oppose Junior."

"And you? Will you join me?!"

Darkness.

Flashes.

Darkness.

"You rarely come down to me, Middle," the darkness responds almost silently. "Very rarely. Otherwise you would have known that the Hecatoncheires [5] are holding back the pressure from Tartarus with more and more difficulty. And sooner or later the Hundred-handed may succumb to it. Then I will welcome any ally: no matter if it's one of the Family, or a Half-Man, or a Lone Scavenger - if only he knows how to kill permanently. Junior is an arrogant tyrant, but on that day he will be the first of the fighters. And you, Middle, would you prefer to sit it out in your depths? Do not be offended, I'm just saying... In short, I would advise you not to worry too much about the future fate of the Lone Scavenger. He is mortal - and that says it all; at least for me. We need to worry about those who are accumulating strength down there, in Tartarus. And your claims to power do not concern me. I am not striving for power, what I have is enough for me. And I will not inform Junior about our conversation."

"Thanks for that at least," Middle mutters discontentedly. "Oh, Senior, you will reconsider - but it will be too late. Make sure you don't regret it afterwards..."

"I will, I will. And you make sure you don't hurt yourself - I can see here, but you... Ah, I warned you! Here you have Erebus, here it is dangerous to shake the earth..."

* * *

When Middle's heavy steps died away in the distance, irritated Senior spat and muttered:

"You're such a fool, brother! Straight as a spear - so you fly straight where you were thrown! Hera steers you as she wishes, and you still think that it's the other way around... Oh, Blackmane! Wish you had at least a little bit of brains..."

Something rustled in the damp, crimson darkness - however, only now it became clear that the darkness had noticeably thinned out after the departure of Middle, turning into gloom.

"You, Trickster?"

"Me, uncle."

"Been overhearing?"

"Me? Never."

"I see. And have you heard much?"

"Enough, uncle."

"Have you been upstairs?"

"I have."

"And... what's going on there?"

"It is done. Dad has just returned to the Family. And tired Nyx the Night will soon leave Thebes."

For some time, Senior was digesting what he heard.

"Trickster?!"

"Yes, uncle?"

"You know what, Hermes - fly to the Moirai! Find out what they are spinning for the dowry of the future newborn. We cannot change fate, but knowing it... knowing it would not hurt. Anything is possible..."

"Yes, Overlod!" Trickster shouted out of tune in a squeaky voice, which most likely made Senior frown - because the gloom instantly turned black, becoming the original darkness.

"You joker... I told you a hundred times - you can act the ape in front of strangers. Or with your father. With me - don't. I do not like it. Alright - fly, kid."

* * *

Hermes was gone for quite a long time, and Senior was already beginning to wonder where this rogue had gone - when at last there was a rustle again and the slightly winded messenger flopped on the bank of the Styx next to Senior.

"Strange things, Overlord," Trickster was unusually serious, and this time it did not occur to Senior to interrupt his nephew. "There I am, arriving to the Moirai, and I ask them - and they only shrug their shoulders. Nothing, they say, not yet, the thread is not spun, the lot has not been drawn, and of course has not been written down. I, naturally, start prying - the old hags must be hiding something! - and then lo and behold, Clotho's thread has started! And not a simple thread, but a double and twisted one..."

"Twins," whispered Senior.

"Twins," immediately agreed Trickster. "But for a thread to be twisted - the Moirai themselves cannot recall this! In short, we untwisted it somehow..."

"'We?'" Overlord literally jumped up.

"We," Hermes confirmed with dignity. "I helped too! But all in vain - in the end it got twisted again. So when two lots were drawn, they could not figure out which one goes to whom. However, what is there to figure out, the shards were almost the same..."

"And the lot, what is the lot?!" almost shouted Senior.

And then Trickster bent down right to Overlord's ear and whispered something.

The flashes blinked, puzzled, and went out.


### First epeisodion.

#### 1

...It happened two hours before dawn, at that damned time when the light-winged Hypnos the Dream, son of the many-starred Nyx, reigns supreme; and the sentries of the seven-gate Thebes doze off, each time shuddering and looking around - and Hypnos laughs inaudibly and splashes poppy infusion from cupped palms into the faces of the slothful guards.

It happened two hours before dawn.

From afar, from the side of the Cephissus valley, a barely audible rumble came - a confused one, reminiscent of the sound of stones crumbling on the slopes of Cithaeron - and it rushed on, approaching and intensifying, gradually drowning out the chirping of cicadas, echoing in the tops of cypress trees and causing frightened birds to flap their wings anxiously.

"Look at him racing," grumbled Thelem the Nasal, the senior guard of the post at the southeastern gates of Thebes, and wrapped himself tighter in a woolen cape.

"Whom, uncle?" **A better term? Something informal, but with a degree of respect.** - A youth, almost a boy, who was sitting next to Thelem, timidly asked, blinking his long girlish eyelashes.

"How should I know, whom?" Nasal responded gloomily, and the young man shivered, listening to the oncoming roar, and then pulled a short spear with a leaf-shaped head closer to him.

Thelem glanced sideways at the young man, grunted, scratched his sunken nose bridge and made a grimace that could be generously called encouraging.

"Don't be afraid, silly," a fatherly note broke through Thelem's voice. "If you're going to reach for the spear each time - I will have you fired from the guard. You better learn to listen..."

"So what is there to listen to, uncle?" The young man shrugged his shoulders in bewilderment. "It just rumbles and rumbles... as if a monster gallops on a hundred hooves."

"Spread your ears!" **a better expression?** Nasal yelled at the stupid youth. "I am not an 'uncle' to you! To you twit I'm mister senior guard! Got it? Monsters he hears! What if I taught you a good lesson right now!.. A hundred-hoofed wonder..."

"Leave the lad alone, Nasal," the third guard responded lazily - a stocky bearded man in a leather carapace with sparse bronze plaques. Before that, the bearded man had been sitting, leaning against the wall, and keeping silent, thoughtlessly twirling a torn stalk in his fingers; now, bored with this occupation, he decided to join the conversation.

"And you, Philid, don't cut in when nobody's asking you!" snapped Thelem, hitting his knee with his fist in annoyance. "That's the lad's second month in the guard - it's about time he learns to tell apart a monster from a chariot! Oh, you're going to spoil him..."

"A chariot?" the youth raised his eyebrows in surprise. "So then... shouldn't we make a fuss, uncle mister senior guard?"

"What for?"

"What do you mean 'what for'? If that's a chariot, then that's, I mean... enemies!"

The bearded man laughed and bit the stalk with his strong teeth, and Thelem gave the young man a slight slap on the back of the head.

"Enemies... You knotty club! **a better expression?** Enemies don't ride in on a single chariot and don't rush along an unfamiliar road, especially at night! This must be a friend, a local, who both knows the way, and isn't holding the reins for the first time in his life. Who though? What do you think, Philid?"

"I..." the bearded Philid began, but then the rumble became very close, **adjust expression here - one action right after another** and Philid briskly jumped to his feet, not waiting for Nasal's order, and began to climb the stairs to the wall, which in this place was no higher than fifteen cubits.

He was on the wall just in time.

A heavy war chariot, harnessed by a pair of lathered horses, flew out from behind a bend in the road, catching and crushing a thorny maquis bush growing on the shoulder, and the driver, poorly discernible in the predawn twilight, pulled on the reins with a powerful jerk, holding back the horse gallop and forcing the animals to stop at the very gates.

"Open up, sleepyheads!" the low voice of the driver rolled across the land like a thunder, and the young man looked scaredly at Thelem, who shrugged his mighty shoulders, as if stretching before a fist fight. "Hey, you're going to oversleep the city! Hurry up!"

"You're going to have to wait until morning," Philid informed him sharply **a better expression?** from the wall. "Order of basileus [6] Creon - not to let anyone into the city until dawn. That clear?"

"Come on, didn't you recognize me, Philid?"

The voice of the newcomer no longer resembled thunder - no, rather, it was now like the roar of a seasoned lion, full for the time being, but ready to get hungry at any moment.

Philid was still thinking and trying to get a better look, putting his palm to his forehead like a visor, but Thelem had already took off and began to fussily unlock the gate.

"There you go, my lord," Nasal fiddled with the bolt that did not want to give in, and the young man watched the senior guard with surprise, since he had never seen him like that. "Almost there... almost..."

The gates trembled, creaked - and the chariot slowly drove into the opening. Thelem, who had become unusually helpful, rushed almost under the wheels and at the last moment managed to intercept the reins thrown to him.

"Welcome back, my lord!" Nasal bowed deeply, pressing his gnarled paw to his heart. "Oh, didn't you drive the horses hard... no matter, I will walk them, dry them, they will be as good as new! Don't you worry, my lord..."

The newcomer jumped lightly from the chariot, flapping the sides of his wide cloak, and slapped Nasal on the shoulder in a friendly manner - which made the stalwart guard sway considerably, but he persisted, grinning happily.

"You'll drive the chariot to my house after the shift!" ordered the night visitor. "You'll get a pithos of wine and clothes for all three of you. Also, one more thing - don't worry about your brother. He is alive and will be at home by noon - I ordered Panopeus of Phocis to march towards Thebes at dawn. We took good booty in Taphos, enough for everyone! And your brother is a decent warrior; people like that are not bypassed when the loot is divided. Well, goodbye, guard Thelem!"

And with broad marching steps he headed away along the street leading to the city center and Cadmea, the inner fortress.

"He remembers," Thelem grunted contentedly, starting to unharness the snorting **what sound do horses make when they are tired?** horses. "He remembers me, and my brother, and every warrior in person... How long ago was it that we raided the Teleboans for the first time, and he still remembers. In a word - a hero! If he were to tell me: let us go, Thelem, together against the Lapiths [7] - I would go! I swear by Zeus of Dodona, I would go! He says my brother will be back by noon... oh, we're going to get drunk on the undiluted one!

"Who was that anyway, uncle?" the youth brought up, but Nasal did not hear him, immersed in joyful dreams about the upcoming drinking bout.

"It was Amphitryon," Philid, who came down from the wall, answered instead of Thelem. "Amphitryon Perseid [8], a friend of Basileus Creon and the pride of all Hellas. Got it, you ignoramus?"

"Got it," the youth nodded. "Amphitryon Perseid, the pride of Hellas. The one Who married his own niece, and then killed his father-in-law with a club. What's not to get - the pride, and in general..."

"Well, what do expect from a fool?!" Philid scratched the back of his head and spat in frustration. "I'm not going to intercede for you before Thelem anymore! So he killed his father-in-law... It was by accident! And besides - I would have killed my father-in-law long ago! He's got to me, can't stand the old stump anymore!.. But I don't! Because I'm not a hero. If I were a hero..."

The young man nodded once more, not listening to Philid and looking at the street along which the hero Amphitryon Perseid had been walking just recently.

The street was empty, but the youth could still imagine the wings of an expensive cloak and the confident gait of a night visitor who looked like a god.

Cheerful, fearless and merciless.


#### 2

Passing through the courtyard, Amphitryon ran up the steps with ease and entered the house, which he had left almost a year ago, having gone on a campaign against the Taphians.

"Were all the captured islands worth it?" he thought, approaching the bedchamber, and smiled sadly, leaving this question unanswered. The slave girl who was sleeping on the doorstep did not wake up when he appeared, curled up in a ball and snoring sweetly - and he had to kick her first, and then clamp her mouth so that she would not wake up all the servants with her screeching. When it dawned on the stupid girl that no one was trying to violate her (which she was quite upset about), and it was just that the owner, who had been absent for a long time, returned, she nimbly fled deeper into the house, and Amphitryon unlocked the fibula of his cloak, letting it fall to the floor, stepped over the threshold and froze like a boy.

He had women. He, a thirty-three-year-old man, had many women, both before Alcmene and after her; he knew all the tricks of the priestesses of Aphrodite, he knew the accidental passion of the daughters and sisters of those hospitable hosts in whose houses he had to stay, he experienced acute pleasure from the horror and pain of the captives, who often had not yet reached female adulthood - but he never loved anyone like this woman sprawled on the bed, the daughter of his uncle Electryon, the daughter of his own sister Anaxo, his niece, cousin and wife at the same time.

Madly.

Furiously and selflessly.

With the kind of love gods do not forgive.

Amphitryon sharply exhaled the air, which suddenly became painfully burning, and fell to his knees beside the bed, tearing off and tossing aside the linen chiton, thrusting his face into the hot permissiveness and not having time to be surprised that the bed turned out to be crumpled and scattered, as if abundant sacrifices to Cypris the Black, the mistress of carnal pleasures, were made in it, or if Alcmene had nightmares all night.

He was not thinking, and he was not surprised.

He was awkward and greedy and unusually rushed.

He was.

* * *

...When the ability to reason returned to him, he wearily leaned back on the pillows, scattering powerful bumpy hands covered in scars and mindlessly staring at the ceiling.

Something prevented him from relaxing.

That was not how he imagined the moment of return. Everything turned out too mundane, too fast and insipid, and dissatisfaction was like a splinter stuck in his brain, making it difficult to calm down and say to himself: "Well, I'm home at last!"

The heavy palm of Amphitryon, covered with calluses from the spear and the hilt of the sword, mechanically lay on the breast of his wife, who still had not woken up completely.

The breast was wet and hot.

"Praise heaven," Alcmene muttered sleepily, arching slightly under the touch. "And you were saying - the wound or something, got shoved with a spear in a stupid way... so it does not work as before. Worked at last... as before. Lied about the wound, didn't you? Those captive girls wore you out, right?"

At first he did not understand.

"What wound?" he asked, lifting his head.

Alcmene did not answer. She breathed evenly and deeply, and the tangled mane of her black hair gleamed faintly in the twilight of the bedchamber.

"I'm saying, what wound?" Amphitryon asked irritably, chilling with a strange presentiment that something in his fate is breaking now, only no one knows this, and nothing can be changed anymore.

"Your wound, what else," without opening her eyes, Alcmene answered with a barely noticeable hoarseness in her voice, which was exciting him so much before. "You've been toiling since midnight... five times you started this way and that — and then you gnash your teeth and run back and forth! Well, sleep, sleep, you need to rest... don't go anywhere else, dear, let's live like normal people... I'll give you a son... two... and a daughter..."

He waited until Alcmene fell asleep completely, then got up and went out into the yard wearing only a loincloth.

The sky was gray and faded.

Amphitryon Perseid looked into the sky, and only the enemies killed by him in many battles could confirm: yes, it was with such eyes that he looked at us, delivering the final blow. People did not gossip for nothing that Perseus the Gorgon-slayer and all his offspring had something left in their eyes from Medusa's gaze, which turned living things into Parian marble.

"Whoever you are," Amphitryon growled dully, and purple veins bulged around his neck, "whoever you are, be damned! Do you hear? Damned!"

Then he fell to his knees, as he had fallen in front of his wife's bed, and pushed his forehead into the sand of the courtyard, which had cooled down during the night.

The frightened slave girl looked out of the house, yelped soundlessly and hid again.

"I can't believe my eyes! By the hooves of Silenus! Is it you, my friend, the great and glorious lavaget [9] Amphitryon?! Some wine here! Wine for me and my friend, red Pramneios, and a jug of cold water! Heroes drink in Colchis manner, without diluting, and pour water on their heads after drinking!.. Climb up here, Amphitryon, - here, on this dais, you feel closer to heaven, and I remember your love for everything elevated... No, it's not your love, but Cephalus's from Thoricos, but I also remember your tastes, if I weren't Elphistiс **any mythological reference?** Troezenid! **Was he actually a descendant of Troezen the guy, or just from Troezen the city? The Russian usage points to the former, and "Troezenid" is used later by itself...** I remember everything, everything..."

"You do, you do, but it is absolutely not necessary to yell about it for the whole tavern to hear," Amphitryon thought with slight annoyance, climbing up the dais and sitting down on a stool next to his former ally in the Taphian campaign Elphistic Troezenid, a stout red-bearded lout in a chiton made of expensive fabric, the original color of which was already impossible to find out, to such an extent the clothes were soaked in wine and grease.

A half-empty jug stood on the table near Troezenid, and a bull's thigh was lying around, gnawed as if it had been in the maw of a lion.

"Some wine here!" Elphistic barked and slammed his fist on the edge of the table. The jug jumped, falling on its side, and the remnants of its contents spilled onto the floor. Elphistic looked at the puddle that had formed, sighed and added, now more quietly, "Well, then even more so - some wine..."

Amphitryon knew perfectly well that taking offense at Elphistic, as well as taking him seriously, was stupid and useless. Troezenid was always like that, either sober (which did not happen often), or tipsy - loud, direct, and simple like a table corner.

However, Elphistic sure knew how to fight. And did not know how to betray. More was not required from an ally. During the Taphian campaign Amphitryon and Elphistic had enough time to become friends, and Elphistic's unbridled fury was perfectly complemented in battle by Amphitryon's cold prudence - so that the latter was even somewhat glad of this chance meeting, which allowed him to forget his worries and plunge into a thoughtless soldier's revelry.

* * *

More than two months that passed since his return were like torture for Amphitryon. He immersed himself headlong into affairs, personally supervised the division of the loot and the allocation of shares to the families of the fallen warriors, accompanied almost to the very Lake Copais some shepherds with a herd of cows - an annual tribute to the warlike city of Orchomenos, a tribute that Amphitryon himself considered humiliating, but was afraid to directly state this to Creon of Thebes. Then he commissioned a new shield and a dozen spearheads from the weaponsmiths; he returned home late, was affectionate with his wife and every minute he was afraid to lose temper and hit her.

With a backhand swing, as the owners of cheap whores - porns **or pornes?** - in the ports do when they conceal a part of the proceeds.

He understood that Alcmene was not to blame for anything.

It was just that when he looked at her, when he touched her body, listened to her moans and shallow breathing - he could not get rid of the thought that just like this, sincerely and selflessly, she gave herself to that one, the nocturnal one, the stranger, unable to distinguish her husband from a god...

And in the morning he was getting up and leaving the house.

* * *

The fat-bellied owner was already hurrying to them with a jug in one hand - they were very similar, a pot-bellied jug and a well-fed owner - and a silvered goblet in the other. The same goblet stood next to Elphistic. The expensive utensils were intended only for dear guests, that is, for those who would not try to shove the goblet in their clothes and sneak away with it. A light breeze, cool and at the same time saturated with the aromas of roasting carcasses, was blowing over the heated faces, the meat seemed to Amphitryon unexpectedly tasty, and the wine was not at all as trashy as he had initially assumed; he settled down more comfortably, the noise of the tavern and everyday worries got strangely intertwined, mixed together and moved down somewhere - here, on a dais, in artificial solitude, Amphitryon really felt closer to the sky and also thought that the red-haired Elphistic really chooses the best places, whether in battle or in a tavern...

Only then did he notice that Troezenid had been telling him something for some time, and forced himself to concentrate on the interlocutor.

"And I'll tell you what, my friend," Elphistic lowered his voice, as it seemed to him, to a whisper, only this whisper came out very, very loud. "The gods clearly favor us! Got it?"

"G-got it," Amphitryon, already slightly drunk, shook his heavy head. "Gods favor us! And... why did you decide that? Did you go to a soothsayer, or something?"

"Just remember our campaign! All the battles - top notch! Praise Ares, of course, but you and I weren't slacking off either! Then - wells, when necessary, came across, and no one threw rotten meat there; deserters swarmed to us, that one, what's her name... Comaetho, daughter of basileus Pterelaos, fell head over heels in love with you, and the whole Taphos to us on a silver plate... a damned pirate's nest, weren't we right to do it!"

"And I killed her later," Amphitryon responded gloomily, trying in vain to remember the face of the Taphian princess Comaetho. He remembered her scream, when the blade of the sword plunged into the soft female belly without the usual resistance, the blood on the white peplos he also remembered, but the face for some reason he could not recall.

At all.

"And good for you!" Elphistic rejoiced, enthusiastically waving with a bull's bone. "I said to Panopeus back then too: you know, Panopey **diminutive used in Russian; should we translated it? how?**, good for our Amphitryon! He, I said, understands it well - now Taphos is ours anyway, it won't go anywhere, and what, are we to take this patricide, a Taphian snake, home now?! The gods guided your hand, my friend, truly gods did..."

"And I killed her later," Amphitryon repeated without listening to Elphistic, pouring himself out of a jug. "Her belly was... soft. And I broke the sword afterwards. Shouldn't have, probably..."

"Of course you shouldn't," Elphistic tried to bite the bone, on which there was absolutely no meat left, and did bite, but then changed his mind and threw it at the owner, who was bustling downstairs, at the hearth.

"Shouldn't have! We're going to need swords... Any day now, we will go on a campaign again. I got a sign recently! From there!"

And he pointed a shiny finger at the sky.

"A sign?" Amphitryon became interested. "What sign?"

Elphistic bent to his friend's ear with a noticeable effort and whispered theatrically:

"My Enonia **Any mythological prototype? Sounds kind of like Oenone** - well, you know her! - was visited by Ares the god of war himself!"

"Really?!" Amphitryon feigned surprise, because he really knew the busty Enonia, the wife of Troezenid, and knew her much better than Elphistic himself had assumed. And in his mind it was coming up: the night, a sleepy and indifferently detached Alcmene, an unpleasant coldness in the chest, and her words: "Praise heaven... worked at last... the captive girls wore you out, right?" And the sand, the cold sand of the courtyard, painfully scratching the forehead, and the howl, the howl rising from within, from the depths, from such abysses of the soul which Amphitryon never knew existed.

Who was that with her that night?!

"I'm telling you for sure!" Elphistic was not calming down. "Enonia now carries his child! Fat she became, the belly is higher than the nose... she's going to start oinking soon."

"What month?" Amphitryon inquired mechanically, staring into the goblet.

"Third. And the belly is as if was the sixth."

"And mine's in the third too..."

"What, Ares as well?"

"I don't know. Me, I guess... or Ares."

"And mine - without a doubt! He! Ares-Enyalius [10]! Enonia said, even during this business, he did not take off his helmet. Honored us, that is. But my Enonia is so stupid - can't handle her now! Every night she repeats: 'Now Ares - that was the real thing! It was divine! Truly - a god... a spearman! And you're just a raggy billygoat...' And what about me? Sure, I’m not a spearman - although the women haven't complained so far! Listen, Amphitryon, let's go on a campaign! Otherwise I will croak, trying to please her..."

"Ah, quit it!" unexpectedly for himself Amphitrion hissed through clenched teeth. "Divine, divine... We all know how it is - divine! They just gnash their teeth and run around the bedchamber - and that's all the love there is!"

"Say what?" Elphistic goggled his eyes.

"That! You know what! The man thing! Even though you and I will die some day, we will die as men, and over Acheron we will be taken as men, and they will continue to... how many times have I called myself a god when I snuck over to other people's wives! Either Ares, or Hermes, and one time even made up some Pantelis-of-the-river **a reference to a joke poem by M. Bukanov** on the spot..."

"No, you wait a moment!" Elphistic grabbed Amphitryon by the shoulder. "You wait! Don't start slandering the gods! Some Pantelis-of-the-river you are... My Enonia, after Ares, does not even want to lie with me! I even put on a helmet, and take a shield - no way! And you're saying - the man thing..."

"I'm saying, meaning I know!" Amphitryon raised his voice completely forgetting himself. "I know! You can love your Enonia with a spear after Ares - but I know! My Alcmene also had one of these over! Of the Olympians!"

"Well?!" Elphistic leaned forward.

"'Well?!'" Amphitryon mocked him. "Well nothing! He even ended up pretending to be me - no go. Didn't work out! Just like he lay down on the bed, so he left with nothing to show for it. **A bit of an awkward construction... better phrasing?** A spearman! The spear does not even stand by itself, keeps falling. And just then I came back - and for him, for the Olympian, I did my best! And I was so surprised too, the fool, that Alcmene was so... tired, I guess? And the bedding was all crumpled..."

"But she's expecting, isn't she!" Elphistic frowned uncomprehendingly. "You said it yourself!"

"I did! She is expecting - but the child is mine! Mine! And only mine! Divine! Ha!"

"Well, who was it, anyway?" Elphistic clearly believed the story, and now he was primarily interested in what deity had been so shamefully disgraced?!

"I don't know," Amphitryon clung to the goblet and began to drink greedily, sprinkling wine around.

"Whom do you suspect then?"

Amphitryon did not have time to answer. Choking on wine, he coughed convulsively and, having heard a crack, did not immediately realize that it was a leg of Elphistic's stool that had broken. Troezenid cried out, falling back, waved his arms as if he was about to fly, but he could not keep his balance and, with all his considerable carcass, thundered down from the dais.

Amphitryon could do nothing. He was sitting, coughing and staring blankly as Elphistic fell backwards, as ill-fated as it was at all possible, and hit the back of his head against a bronze skewer hook sticking out of the wall.

The cough vanished without a trace. The blood drained from Amphitryon's face, and the crimson color of his cheeks instantly changed to deathly pallor, and large drops of sweat appeared on his forehead.

"Elphistic! Are you... are you alive?"

On stiff legs, Amphitryon descended from the dais, where he had just recently been closer to the sky, and bent over the body of a friend, which was spread on the floor.

"Elphistic..."

Troezenid was dead. The hook pierced the back of his head with a pointed end and half-entered the brain, so that Elphistic died instantly - he probably didn't even have time to get scared.

However, getting scared was something he did not know how to do.

And now he will never learn.

People were already gathering around, a hunchback slave boy, one of the scullions, was fussing and sobbing, someone ran after a healer, although there was no need for that; nearby the owner was lamenting, mourning not so much over a guest perished so absurdly, but more over the possible loss of the profits of his establishment - for how many would go drinking to an establishment with such an ill fame?..

"How come?" Amphitryon muttered in confusion, backing away. "How come? How many battles - and not a scratch! And here..."

"And you would be well-advised to blab less, my dear fellow," someone's unfamiliar and unpleasant voice whispered in Amphitryon's ear. "Blab less - live longer. And if you start gossiping, something may collapse under you too! Out of the blue. I hope you understand what I mean?"

When the meaning of what was said finally reached Amphitryon, he turned - with a jerk, with his whole body, as he used to turn in a shield fight - but he saw only a back in a dirty chlamys with a hood, hiding in the crowd. He rushed after it - no use, the trail of the mysterious adviser was long gone.

...Amphitryon returned home gloomy and absolutely sober. And he thought hard.

There was something to think about.


#### 4

For several days after that unfortunate incident, Amphitryon walked around as if thunderstruck: he did not hear people talking to him, every now and then he bumped into tables and beds, dropped various household utensils; spoke little and more and more irrelevantly, hardly ate, but drank a lot without getting drunk; often froze in place, looking at the sky (or at the ceiling) for a long time and moving his lips soundlessly...

Poor Alcmene was completely worn out, seeing what was happening with her husband, and not being able to help in any way - but after ten days Amphitryon's healthy nature took over, and he began to gradually come to his senses. He remembered the accumulated deeds during that time, for starters ordered to flog two careless slaves, which immediately turned them into careful ones, and very much so - in short, the grandson of Perseus and the son of Alcaeus of Mycenae was quickly turning into the former active, loud and powerful Amphitryon; and Alcmene sighed with relief.

Praised be heavens, the gods did not take away the husband's mind!

However, no one intended to take Amphitryon's mind - it seems that the gods had enough of their own, and if they did not, they would not have thought of borrowing this valuable (or not so much) item from the husband of the beautiful Alcmene.

It's just that Amphitryon Perseid, who was previously called an exile, and then a hero, for the first time in his life seriously considered what is his life worth in this world - and indeed any life in general. It was not so much the death of Elphistic that shocked Amphitryon - in his lifetime he had seen enough deaths, more absurd than that one, and more terrible, and all other kinds - as the circumstances of that death. A visit of a deity to Alcmene and his eventual disgrace; his, Amphitryon's, stupid and careless gossip - and a hook in the back of Troezenid's head... and the voice, the unpleasant voice of a ragamuffin in a dirty chlamys, warning of the harmful consequences of excessive blabbing.

But all the same - to think for a long time, especially when it's no use whether you think or not, Amphitryon could not. And then, as bad luck would have it, a message came from the pastures in the nearest valley of Cephissus that robbers seemed to have appeared there that steal goats and sheep.

Amphitryon immediately armed part of his servants - choosing reliable people and those who had been in battle - and marched southeast towards Cephissus in order to put an end to the robbery.

Although, upon arrival it became clear almost immediately that there was robbery, but there were no robbers; or rather, it’s not that there were none at all, and the goats were really disappearing - but only because the herders of the flocks, that is, the shepherds, are very fond of meat. And they are very fond of it more often than they should. Especially accompanied by young wine, which in around there almost flowed in streams.

There was a lot of meat. It maad, baad, and grazed very close. The meat was the owners', and it was tasty - which constitued a contradiction. Therefore, the shepherds honestly had fought the temptation every time - and every time the temptation had triumphed...

Having found that out, instead of flying into a rage, as his companions expected, Amphitryon laughed for a long time, then ordered to give a whipping to the guilty shepherds (mainly for their inability to lie) and recover what they had eaten from the part of the offspring promised to them; after which he set off on the return journey.

The shepherds watched him leave, scratching their swollen backs, and marveled at such a light punishment.

The sight of the meat made them unwell...

And Amphitryon, returning to Thebes, completely forgot about the shepherds and about the losses, as soon as he had a chance to see his house.

The entire eastern part of it, where the gynaeceum, the women's chambers, was located, bore obvious traces of fire. The burned doorway, the courtyard covered with a layer of dirty soot, the cracked and blackened roof tiles, where several slaves were now busy re-tiling the roof anew, spoke of the same thing.

Amphitryon gasped, quickened his steps, then ran...

Alcmene, limping slightly, went out to meet him from the door of the megaron - the central hall for men's feasts and business meetings, fenced off by a low stone balustrade; she went down the steps, and Amphitryon, with inexpressible relief, drew his wife to him. He stroked her silky hair, seemed to be saying something and could not possibly stop, feeling how her heart was beating, and how the breath was heaving Alcmene's chest - he could not let her go, especially now, after the shock he had experienced, and only one the thought was beating in his head: "Praise Zeus - alive!.. alive... alive!.."

Why praise Zeus, and not someone else - he did not think about.

Later he listened to the story of what had happened, and his face during that did not express anything.

* * *

...Shouts "Fire!" started in the middle of the night. Apparently, someone knocked over an oil lamp, the carpet caught fire - well, and from there it started blazing.

Half-asleep, Alcmena did not immediately realize what was the matter, but the incessant cries of "We're on fire!" and the smoky fumes, already seeping through the cracks, quickly informed her what had happened. Having hastily wrapped herself in a peplos [11], Alcmene rushed to the exit, but a fold of the carpet, as if alive, slipped under her feet, a sharp pain pierced her ankle... smoke drifted around, her throat started tickling, her head was spinning... Alcmene understood with utmost clarity that she could not get up - and would either burn or suffocate in the smoke. She screamed with all her strength - and fell into a bottomless smoky well, on the rapidly approaching bottom of which...

Two freedmen from the servants who had broken down the door to the gynaeceum managed to carry her outside. Almost immediately a downpour hit, knocking down and extinguishing the predatory tongues of flame that escaped from under the roof, and in the rain Alcmene came to her senses. The rain heavily trampled on the dying fire, the smell of freshness quickly displaced the suffocating fumes from the lungs... fortunately, no one died, and the fire did not cause any significant losses either.

Although, they did not manage to find out who turned over the fatal lamp, or whether there was any lamp at all.


#### 5

The roof had been repaired pretty quickly, the gynaeceum was put in order, and for several days Amphitryon literally did not leave his wife's side, trying to be around at all times and not let Alcmene out of the house.

However, after the fire, which ultimately ended well, nothing much happened, so Amphitryon gradually calmed down and when Alcmene expressed a desire to go to the market with two maids to do some shopping, he did not object - and why would he?

So they went - Alcmene and two swarthy broad-hipped Phoenician slave girls.

The market, located in the lower part of the city, greeted women with noisy polyphony, shouts of barkers, a motley variety of clothes and shades of skin color; and first of all, all kinds of aromas - from the fragrance of peaches and almonds to the pungent smell of fresh fish.

First, Alcmene wanted fruit. For a long time she was choosing the pomegranates that caught her fancy, whose crack glittered with ruby-red, juicy, sweet-tart grains; then she bought some dried melon. Once next to the fish rows, she slowed down, sniffed and reconsidered getting the fish, turning to the butchers, where various smoked meats, to which Alcmene had recently become addicted, were hung on knobby poles.

The slaves obediently followed their mistress.

That's when a beggar clung to them. Short, scrawny, in an incredibly dirty chlamys with a hood, because of which the beggar's face remained in the shadows at all times.

"Alms for a wretched cripple!" the beggar howled behind the women's backs, grabbing the slaves by the clothes (nonetheless, the beggar looked quite healthy). "Alms for Zeus's sake! And for Apollo's! And for Athena's! And Dionysus's! And Hermes's! And Artemis's! And... all the rest! Alms, I'm begging you! What is it to you?! Alms!.."

There were many gods, and the ragamuffin could enumerate them endlessly, so Alcmene tried to get rid of the beggar by handing him the smallest pomegranate - and regretted it. The beggar immediately realized that there was booty **a better word?** to be gained there, and resumed his pestering with renewed vigor.

Then Alcmene tried not to pay attention to him - and, oddly enough, she succeeded. Especially when she stopped near the poles with Thessalian smoked meats. Alcmene was meticulously choosing a better piece for some time, and the black-bearded fat merchant kept constantly praising his goods, glancing sideways at the enviable hips of the slave girls - and from his chatter and the smell of smoky meat, Alcmene felt dizzy, so she seemed to have poked her finger not at the piece she had almost chosen, but at the next, a little suspicious one.

The fat man smartly removed the selected piece, oozing compliments, and one of the slave-girls had almost put up the basket **a better way to translate 'было'?**, when a silent and therefore forgotten beggar jumped out from behind her.

He snatched the smoked goat from the merchant, jumped back, and, drooling all over, clawed at the meat with his yellow teeth, grimacing and devouring the stolen goods with incredible speed.

There was silence, and only the beggar was smacking loudly, and the Adam's apple on his unwashed neck was moving back and forth as he was letting the unchewed bits pass. The silence, however, lasted less than the beggar would have wished: Alcmene gasped in astonishment, the two slave girls shrieked, and the black-bearded merchant retrieved, cursing, a heavy stick from somewhere and, waddling on his short legs, moved toward the petty thief who did not stop chewing for a moment.

And the impudent man would not have avoided a good beating - and rightfully so! - but then the fancier of other people's goat stopped working his jaws, dropped the rest of the meat into the dust, and grabbed his stomach with both hands.

"Poisoned! I'm dy-y-y... ing!!!" the beggar's cry echoed over the market, almost drowning out everyone's noise and commotion.

"He's faking it, the scoundrel," the owner of the stolen meat raised his stick above the thief rolling on the ground, but he didn't put it down, just froze in indecision.

The screaming transformed quickly into an inarticulate howl; the man was no longer writhing on the ground but twitching feebly, clutching his stomach; the face of the poor sod got covered in beads of sweat, his lips got foamy, his hoarse breath was coming out with difficulty through clenched teeth.

He was no longer howling or moaning, but just whimpering faintly.

It suddenly dawned on Alcmene *who* could have ended up in the beggar's place if he hadn't eaten that ill-fated goat meat, and Alcmene, despite the midday heat, got chills.

And it dawned on the fat merchant *whose* meat poisoned the beggar, and the fat man hurried to disappear, and did it so masterly that the hapless thief would be well advised to learn that art from him.

"Healer!" Alcmene called out as if suddenly awakened.

"Healer!" the slave girls wailed after her.

"Healer!" the crowd chanted discordantly.

Soon a healer did push his way to the scene of the accident; a withered gray-haired old man who resembled an autumn dandelion, if it was dressed for laughs in a long-skirted hymation and brand new red sandals, obviously just bought here at the market.

The healer grimaced with distaste at the sight of his future patient, but leaned over the poisoned man nonetheless, felt his thin wrist, put the ear to his chest, then the hand to his forehead; then pulled a face and sniffed at the smell of his breath.

"Not good," he concluded thoughtfully.

"Will he live?" Alcmene burst out.

The healer glanced at her sternly.

"Perhaps he will," he said, then thought for a moment added, "Or perhaps he won't. It is all on the gods' lap."

And he was about to leave.

"I..." Alcmene touched the healer by the elbow. "I'll pay for the treatment."

The healer was about to leave much less enthusiastically.

One of the slave girls whispered something in his ear, pointing a finger at her mistress.

The healer comletely reconsidered leaving.

"You and you," he pointed at the two sturdy men with calloused craftsmen hands who stood among the gawkers. "Take him and follow me. She will pay you later."

The craftsmen did not think of disobeying. The crowd parted to let the healer pass; the selected porters dragged the poisoned man behind him, followed by Alcmene and her slaves, and the women were followed by a dozen curious bums which are abundant at any market.

The healer's turned out to be nearby. Potions of all sorts were laid out on a mat at its entrance, and a scrawny teenager in a muddy loincloth - probably an apprentice - was pounding quite suspicious roots in a wooden mortar.

"Emetic," the healer ordered briefly, kicking the apprentice in the protruding ass, and the teenager disappeared hurriedly into the tent, abandoning the mortar.

The healer waved to the porters, and everyone but the women and the onlookers followed the apprentice. There must have been another exit of the tent, for soon one could hear disgusting sounds from the other side of the tent - the thief's stomach was spewing stale goat meat accompanied by everything else in it. Judging by the duration of the sounds, the beggar had not been starving for the last decade.

...After all that, the healer came out to Alcmene again.

"He'll live," he replied unequivocally to the silent question. "You can feed him with worms. He'll be down for day or two, and that will be it.

"Do I owe you something?" Alcmene asked straight on, having already paid her porters.

"You bet!" the healer agreed obligingly examining the toes of his fine footwear. "Have a couple amphorae of wine and a sack of millet flour sent to me. Or better still, two sacks. Thank you in advance, my lady."

And with a nod he disappeared into the tent.

The onlookers began to disperse.

And no one saw how the half-dead ragamuffin, carefully laid under the awning behind the healer's tent, opened his eyes, quickly looked around, made sure that no one was nearby, nimbly jumped to his feet - and dashed along the nearest street with such agility as if his tattered crepidae sandals suddenly grew wings...


#### 6

Alcmene said nothing to her husband, but the slaves' chattering knew no bounds.

That night Amphitryon was especially gentle with his wife and afterwards slept restlessly, always waking up and touching Alcmene with his hand, as if he feared that she was about to disappear who knows where.

And in the morning he ordered two black cows to be taken to the temple of Peanus, where they were to be sacrificed to the healer god and the Pharmacid sisters; and another cow to the temple of Zeus Cronion.

Why Zeus? Just in case...

It's just that Amphitryon really disliked these cursed incidents that had haunted his wife since that memorable night.

Oh, gods, gods... what is human life to you? You may elevate in passing, you may trample in passing, and who knows what is worse... **Sophocles quote?**

This thought tormented Amphitryon on the day when Alcmene, accompanied by a huge Ethiopian slave, went to the palace of the basileus Creon, which towered in the southern part of Thebes. She was not, of course, going to Creon himself, but to his wife, Nausicaa, a chubby giggler who was not at all regal (though very pretty) looking. Like their husbands, Alcmene and Nausicaa became friends almost immediately, and the latter often invited her friend to visit, especially when new fabrics were brought in - Alcmene knew exactly which fabrics suited the frivolous Nausicaa, who had birthed many girls for her Creon.

There was nothing special about such a visit, nor was there anything special about the fact that the women had stayed up late talking and trying on clothes, but Amphitryon's heart had been in overdrive these days, and when it began to get dark he could not stand it. There was only one way from his house to Creon's palace (unless one wanders through dirty alleys, which Alcmene would probably not dare to do), so Amphitryon quickly got ready and went out into the gathering twilight, intending to meet his wife.

And soon, coming around another bend, he heard rough laughter and men's voices, and almost immediately frightened and angry voice of Alcmene:

"What are you doing? Don't you understand who I am?!"

Amphitryon quickened his pace and regretted not bringing a weapon.

There were six of them. And you could call them anything but honorable citizens. "And even if they were honorable..." Amphitryon thought angrily, almost tripping over the corpse of the Ethiopian slave with a split skull. Twenty paces away, Alcmene huddled against the fence, and the men surrounded her, encouraging each other with scurrilous jokes. They were clearly not in a hurry.

A little further away stood another man, not so much tall as impossibly broad-shouldered, no longer young, with a curly, graying beard. This one was wrapping himself up in a long aquamarine cloak, and ostensibly had nothing to do with what was going on.

He just stood there and watched...

And whistled softly at Amphitryon's appearance.

The men turned and stared at the newcomer.

"And wh-who's that then?" one of them mumbled.

"I am Amphitryon the Exile," Amphitryon purposely called himself by the old nickname by which he had been known in Thebes when he had come to summon basileus Creon against the Teleboans, with nothing but a young wife, a heavy spear and a terrible fame under his belt. "And this is my wife..."

And in all his voice, in all its brass-like sound that many times rose over the noise of battle:

"Get out of the way, you bastards!"

The rapists staggered at first, but then stopped, looking at each other, and one stepped forward, a big, fat man with a hooked nose and small, sleepy, close-set eyes. A scar, looking like a rain warm, protruded from his left eye, lost in the stubble.

Wobbling, the ringleader moved toward Amphitryon.

He had a curved Thracian knife tucked behind his belt, but he did not draw it, instead reaching forward with his knotty, tree-root-like hand and taking hold of Amphitryon's chiton at the chest.

"A hero," muttered the fat man, and the worm on his cheekbone wriggled lazily. "Look, brothers, that's a hero... three heads in a row..." **some joke rhyming with 'hero'**

And he howled in rage when Amphitryon's tree-hard fingers hit him in the eye, he howled and threw his hands up to his face, and wheezed and gurgled and sank to the ground, grinning fearfully with his new mouth slit under his chin.

No one noticed how the crooked knife from the lout's belt moved into Amphitryon's hand, having washed the throat of its former master with a bronze splash, and immediately darting to the side, entering with a crunch under the collarbone of the quickest one, who had swung a short cudgel.

The others hesitated, fussed around, scurried back behind the broad-shouldered man in the blue-green cloak - but they scurried back in a somewhat strange way, as if they hadn't even noticed him, and then vanished quickly into the evening gloom.

The broad-shouldered man stepped toward Amphitryon, looking at him with squeamish interest - and Amphitryon struck, briefly, skillfully, putting into the blow experience and wicked pain, which made his heart pound dryly and inexorably.

The ground turned out to be surprisingly hard.

Jumping to his feet, he struck again, feeling his legs refusing to serve him, his ribs screaming for mercy and his head filling with a hazy twilight with no hope of a future sunrise.

He struck, not realizing what he was doing.

And hit, smashing his fist bloody as if he were hitting a rock.

Then the ground shoved Amphitryon in the back of the head again.

...The broad-shouldered man stood over him, holding his cheek thoughtfully, and in his piercing eyes contempt inexplicably mingled with amazement. It must be the way a wolf looks at a mad goat kid that has bitten the side of a ferocious beast with its blunt teeth.

"And your wife has hairy thighs," said the broad-shouldered man indifferently, so indifferently that at first it was hard even to take it as an insult. "Like a satyr. You're a midge, hero... Slime."

That's when Amphitryon realized that that was it. It was time to die. Only he could not die, because Alcmene still pressed herself against the fence; he could not die, and he forced himself to stand on his knees - kneeling before the broad-shouldered man was humiliating, but somehow not too much - then on one knee, then...

Then a voice came from somewhere in the darkness, from behind the broad-shouldered man. A snide, almost boyish and very familiar voice - only the haze in his head prevented Amphitryon from remembering where he had heard it before.

"What, uncle, have you decided to become a hero too?" the voice asked. "It doesn't seem right for you."

"You'd better get lost, Dummy!" the broad-shouldered one muttered. "Mind your own business, nephew!"

"I will," the voice said, making it sound too easy. "And I think I shall get lost. I'll get lost very quickly. You might even say, I'll fly away. To my dad. He's mad as Typhon this morning... Well, uncle, shall I go?"

The broad-shouldered "uncle" did not answer. His face twisted in a grimace of anger, visible even in the darkness, he exhaled heavily and, turning sharply, started walking away. His heavy footsteps seemed to shake the ground and linger in the darkness.

Amphitryon seemed to see for a moment a shadowy figure in a hooded cloak in front of him, and he remembered, remembered keenly and painfully, how the very same voice had warned him not so long ago to keep his mouth shut...

He groaned and rose to his feet.

He was ashamed to look at his wife.

And Alcmene looked adoringly at her hero husband, a warrior, her man, who would always save, always protect, always, always...

She did not see the broad-shouldered man, did not hear the strange conversation, for her it all ended with the death of the fat-necked lout - and had not stood over Amphitryon his last opponent, and he had not walked away, undefeated, but suddenly slouching...

None of this had been there for her - as if someone had stolen a handful of minutes from her life.

Except for a glimpse of the familiar hooded chlamys in the darkness, which reminded her so vividly of the recent thief who had poisoned himself with stolen meat.

...And Amphitryon avoided meeting his wife's eyes and wandered on unsteady legs with his head bowed. For the first time in years, he was defeated. And now they are going home only owing to an unknown patron, for whom Amphitryon felt a distinct dislike - though he tried his best to feel gratitude.

The bitterness of the loss, alas, did not grow any sweeter when he thought of the number of enemies he had overcome and the fact that one of them might not be quite human.

If it were to be played over, Amphitryon knew he'd hit him again.

"Oh gods," Amphitryon muttered hollowly, "for what?"

The question was silly and naive; he knew it perfectly well, but he couldn't help asking.

"We must go to Delphi," Alcmene echoed in a faltering voice, stealthily supporting her unsteady husband. "We must ask the Pythia at the sanctuary of Apollo. It is the last thing we have left."

Amphitryon involuntarily imagined Apollo in his guise and in Alcmene's bed - and realized that he did not want to go to Delphi.

Not in the slightest.


#### 7

Alcmene could not be dissuaded from going to the oracle - the hereditary stubbornness of the Perseids had awakened in her, and Amphitryon knew from his own experience that in such cases further persuasion was pointless.

All the more so because Alcmene, who was on her fifth month, was feeling fine, carried her visibly rounded belly with majestic dignity, and in general was not so different from the old Alcmene, except for an unexpected love of Rhodessian **[or Rhodesian? From Rhodes, not from Rhodesia]** smoked meats. Thessalian ones, she could not even look at after that incident in the marketplace.

Amphitryon grudgingly agreed - though he couldn't shake the thought that he was making a terrible mistake in indulging his wife's whim to ask Apollo of Delphi or any other deity, one of which had casually, out of a moment's curiosity, trampled their marital happiness.

However, Alcmene knew nothing of his torment and radiated joy, snuggling up to her husband... while her husband was avoiding her, pleading busyness, afraid to give away even a hint and let Alcmene understand the reason for his gloominess - and Amphitryon regretted only one thing.

That in the long years of his life, the life of a grandson of Perseus, a son of one of the Mycenaean kings, a warrior, a murderer against his will, an exile, a husband, a commander-lavaget - that in these years he had not learned two things.

To forgive insults and to take pride in another's charity.

He was growing gloomy, cursing his pride, and drinking at nights.

One day he let Creon know that he feared the trip to the oracle. Fortunately the booze was now hardly affecting Amphitryon, and this time he managed to stop his inappropriate revelations - and Creon, the basileus of Thebes and a statesman, understood him in his own way. There are quite a few brigands roving around Boeotia[12], aren't there? The next day Amphitryon, who had not slept well, was horrified to learn that the thoughtful Creon had dedicated a detachment of warriors to accompany them, enough to take Delphi by force - if such an idea could ever even occur to anyone.

He had to refuse as politely as he could and personally select a dozen and a half veterans of previous campaigns who were willing to charge anyone for Amphitryon - and, most importantly, who could chrage calmly and judiciously.

A veteran is a warrior who has survived, and that says it all.

Креонт одобрил выбор друга, а Амфитрион умолчал, что из самых живучих отобрал самых опытных, из самых опытных — самых верных, а из самых верных — самых несуеверных, способных не вздрагивать при громе с ясного неба и любящих клясться интимными частями тел олимпийцев.

Почему-то это казалось ему очень важным.

Шестого дня месяца гекатомбеона[13] под приветственные клики толпы из северо-западных ворот Фив выехала и двинулась дальше процессия из трех колесниц, запряженных парами лошадей митаннийской породы, за которыми следовало пятнадцать солдат, вовсю горланящих соленые солдатские песни. Первой колесницей правил лично Амфитрион, а стоявшая позади него Алкмена улыбалась направо и налево, приветственно взмахивая ветвью лавра; второй колесницей правил юный Ликимний, сводный брат Алкмены (отец — Электрион, младший сын Персея — у них был общий, а матерью Ликимния была фригиянка Мидея), такой же буйно-черноволосый, как сестра; а поводья третьей колесницы держал в руках не кто иной, как Телем Гундосый, отпущенный по просьбе Амфитриона из караульщиков и сиявший, как начищенная бляха.


Creon approved of his friend's choice, and Amphitryon did not mention that he selected the most expierenced among the most enduring, the most loyal among the most experienced, and the least supersticious among the most loyal, capable of not flinching at thunder from a clear blue sky and loving to swear by the intimate body parts of the Olympians.

For some reason this seemed very important to him.

On the sixth day of the month of Hecatombeon,[13] to the cheers of the crowd, a procession of three chariots drawn by pairs of Mitanni horses, followed by fifteen soldiers, chanting salty soldierly songs to and fro, rode out of the northwest gate of Thebes. The first chariot was personally ruled by Amphitryon, with Alcmene behind him smiling to right and left, waving a laurel branch; the second chariot was ruled by the young Lycimnion, Alkmene's half-brother (their father, Electrion, the younger son of Perseus, had the same father, and Lycimnion's mother was the Phrygian Midea), who had black hair as wild as his sister; and the reins of the third chariot were held by none other than Thelem the Gundos, released at Amphitryon's request from the guards and shining like a polished plaque.
